# {funkyheatmap}
{funkyheatmap} allows generating heatmap-like visualisations for data frames.
Funky heatmaps can be fine-tuned by providing annotations of the columns and rows,
which allow assigning multiple palettes or geometries or grouping rows and columns together in
categories.

This is an interactive JavaScript adaptation of
[funkyheatmap](https://github.com/dynverse/funkyheatmap) R package to the browser with
[d3.js](https://d3js.org/).

## Installation
If you want to add {funkyheatmap} to your website, you can include `d3.js`, `lodash` and
`funkyheatmapjs` from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com) or other service serving npm packages.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/d3@7"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/lodash@4/lodash.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/funkyheatmapjs"></script>
```

If you have an npm project, you can install npm package `funkyheatmapjs` with npm or yarn.
